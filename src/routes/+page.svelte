        >In the final weeks of the 2004 season registration period, an Arizona
        high school decided they were no longer going to support their robotics
        team.&nbsp;However, two students and two&nbsp;mentors from the team
        wanted to continue their participation in the program. Microchip
        graciously step in and offered them a workspace in one of their
        warehouses to build their robot, and thus the Arizona Community Robotics
        Team, also known as Team CAUTION, was born. It was founded as a
        community team giving students whose schools do not have FIRST teams an
        opportunity to participate in the program.</span
